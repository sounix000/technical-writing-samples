== Overview

Hi, I am link:https://sounix000.github.io/souvik-sarkar.html[Souvik Sarkar] â€” a hobbyist *programmer* and a professional *technical writer*. My current area of interest is _Linux_, with focus on _Security_, and _Cryptography_. 

This page is meant for recruiters and managers hiring for technical writing roles. I hope that the samples provided here will help them decide whether I am good enough for an interview.

== Work samples

Over the last several years, my day job involves writing _open source technical documentation_ for my employer. I have learnt a lot about the docs-as-code paradigm, adherence to style guides, and collaborating in the world of open source software.

This section contains links to *merged pull requests* for the projects on which I worked. If you want to know how I perform in a professional environment, closely observing the pull requests will reveal the details that matter.
