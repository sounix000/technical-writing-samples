When designing a web service, you must carefully evaluate the choice between SOAP and REST. This guide explains their strengths, limitations, and use cases to help you make an informed decision.

== SOAP overview
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging XML-based messages over a network. It uses Web Services Description Language (WSDL) to define:

* Resources, operations, and procedure calls
* Message structure, encoding, and encapsulation
* Bindings with network transport protocols

SOAP APIs are often auto-generated using tools that create server-side and client-side code templates, but the resulting implementations can be challenging to develop and maintain.

=== When to choose SOAP
SOAP is suitable for:

* **Enterprise-level security:** Supports WS-Security for encryption, authentication, and message integrity.
* **Complex transactions:** Ensures reliability in distributed environments through features like ACID-compliant transactions.
* **Strict contracts:** Enforces formal service definitions using WSDL, ensuring consistency and reliability.
* **Stateful interactions:** Useful for cases requiring session management or multi-step workflows.
* **Legacy systems:** Facilitates integration with older enterprise systems.

=== SOAP limitations
* **Tight coupling:** Changes to the server often require updates to the client, reducing flexibility.
* **XML-only payloads:** Mandatory use of XML increases message size and complexity.
* **High overhead:** SOAP messages are verbose, requiring more bandwidth and processing power.
* **Slower development:** Complex implementation results in longer development cycles.

== REST overview
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that leverages standard HTTP methods for stateless web service interactions. REST APIs:

* Use URLs to represent resources.
* Support multiple data formats, including JSON, XML, and HTML.
* Implement HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, and more.
* Can mark responses as cacheable, reducing client-server interactions.

Tools and frameworks can generate REST APIs and documentation from application code, enabling rapid development.

=== When to choose REST
REST is ideal for:

* **Public APIs:** Designed for widespread adoption and third-party integrations.
* **Rapid development:** Simple and flexible, with fewer constraints than SOAP.
* **Data format flexibility:** Supports lightweight formats like JSON, ideal for modern web and mobile applications.
* **Scalability and caching:** Statelessness and response caching improve performance and scalability.
* **Broad adoption:** REST is widely supported by tools, frameworks, and a large developer community.

=== REST limitations
* **Security challenges:** Requires additional measures (e.g., HTTPS, token-based authentication) to ensure security.
* **Limited operations:** Restricts interactions to standard HTTP methods, which may not cover all use cases.
* **Scalability complexities:** Point-to-point communication can complicate scaling with multiple clients.
* **Versioning difficulties:** Major schema changes can break clients if not managed properly.

== Decision guide
* Use **SOAP** for secure, reliable, and stateful operations, especially in enterprise environments or when working with legacy systems.  
* Use **REST** for simple, scalable, and fast APIs that support modern web or mobile applications and prioritize flexibility.

[TIP]
Choose REST for most modern web services unless your requirements specifically align with SOAP’s strengths, such as strict contracts or enterprise-grade security.

== Key considerations
* Assess your team’s expertise with SOAP or REST.
* Plan for future maintenance, including versioning strategies for REST APIs.
* Use tools for API generation and documentation to speed up development and ensure consistency.
