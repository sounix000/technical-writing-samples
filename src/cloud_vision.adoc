* link:https://cloud.google.com/sdk?hl=en[Google Cloud SDK]: Deploy and manage applications using command-line tools.

== Configuring Google Cloud

To set up your project, resources, and APIs in Google Cloud Platform:

1. Sign in to link:https://cloud.google.com/[Google Cloud Platform] using your link:https://www.google.com/account/about/[Google Account] credentials.

2. Create a new project and note the *Project ID*.

3. Create a link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets#storage-create-bucket-console[storage bucket] for the project and set the following *Permissions*:
   - link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/making-data-public#buckets[Public access] to `allUsers`.
   - link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/using-uniform-bucket-level-access#enable[Access control] to `Uniform`.
+
In addition, note the name of the bucket.
+
[WARNING]
====
Setting public permissions exposes your bucket to unrestricted access. Avoid this in production environments.
====
+

4. link:https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/drag-and-drop[Try] the Vision API, then link:https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/setup#api[enable] it for your project.
+
[NOTE]
====
Do not generate authorization credentials when enabling the Vision API using the Google Cloud Console. In the next section, we create the authentication credentials using the `gcloud` utility.
====

== Setting up the project

Create a development environment on your local machine with all necessary packages, Cloud SDK, and client libraries.

=== Creating a development environment

1. Ensure Python 3.x and `pip3` are installed on your system, and upgrade `pip` if necessary:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ python3 --version
$ pip3 --version
$ pip3 install --upgrade pip
----

2. Create a project directory and navigate to it:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ mkdir PROJECT_DIRECTORY
$ cd PROJECT_DIRECTORY
----

3. Set up a virtual environment:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
$ virtualenv VIRTUALENV_NAME
$ source VIRTUALENV_NAME/bin/activate
----
+
Your terminal prompt will change to indicate you are within the virtual environment.

=== Installing Google Cloud SDK

1. Install the link:https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install[Cloud SDK] for your operating system. Accept default options during installation.

2. Initialize the project:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ gcloud init
----
+
When the program prompts, provide inputs that are relevant to the project.

=== Installing and configuring client libraries

1. Install the Storage and Vision client libraries for Python:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ pip3 install --upgrade google-cloud-storage google-cloud-vision
----

2. Create a service account:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ gcloud iam service-accounts create SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
----

3. Grant permissions to the service account:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/owner"
----

4. Generate a key file:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create KEY_FILE.json \
  --iam-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Ensure that the private key in the `KEY_FILE.json` file is unavailable to the public. If you use GitHub or similar services to host the code for this project, add the name of the key file to `.gitignore`.
====

5. Configure the authentication credentials by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the name of the key file.

    . Append the following line to `~/.bashrc` (or your shell's equivalent):
+
[source,bash]
----
$ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="PATH/TO/PROJECT_DIRECTORY/KEY_FILE.json"
----

    . Source the file to make the changes effective:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ source ~/.bashrc
----

== Creating a Python script

Develop a script that:

1. Accepts a directory containing images of famous landmarks.
2. Uploads images to the Cloud Storage bucket.
3. For each uploaded image
    . Uses the Vision API to extract information about the landmarks present in the image.
    . Prints some information of common interest (for example, description and location of the landmark). 

=== Project structure

To complete the project structure, create the following:

* A directory containing images of landmarks.
* A `main.py` file. 

[source]
----
. PROJECT_DIRECTORY
|
|--- VIRTUALENV_NAME
|        |
|        |--- bin
|        |--- include
|        |--- lib
|        |--- lib64
|        |--- pyenv.cfg
|
|--- IMAGE_DIRECTORY
|        |
|        |--- image1.png
|        |--- image2.jpg
|        |--- image3.jpeg
|
|--- KEY_FILE.json
|
|--- main.py

----

=== Sample code in `main.py`

In the `main.py` file, write code which is similar to the following sample:

[source, python]
----
# Import dependencies
from __future__ import print_function
from google.cloud import storage, vision
import io, os

# Define functions
def get_image_names(image_dir):
    """Returns a list containing absolute paths of images."""
    image_abspath_list = []
    for file in os.listdir('./' + image_dir):
        image_abspath_list.append(os.path.abspath(image_dir + '/' + file))
    return image_abspath_list

def upload_landmark_images(bucket_name, image_abspath_list):
    """Returns a list containing relative URIs of uploaded images."""
    relative_storage_uris = []
    storage_client = storage.Client()
    bucket = storage_client.bucket(bucket_name)
    for image_abspath in image_abspath_list:
        image_name = image_abspath.split('/')[-1]
        blob = bucket.blob(image_name)
        blob.upload_from_filename(image_abspath)
        relative_storage_uris.append('gs://' + bucket_name + '/' + image_name)
    return relative_storage_uris

def get_landmark_information(relative_storage_uris):
    """Returns information on uploaded images."""
    vision_client = vision.ImageAnnotatorClient()
    image_object = vision.Image()
    for image_uri in relative_storage_uris:
        image_object.source.image_uri = image_uri
        vision_response = vision_client.landmark_detection(image=image_object)
        print('\n', '+' * 100, '\n')
        print('IMAGE:', image_uri, '\n')
        for landmark in vision_response.landmark_annotations:
            print('=' * 50)
            print('Landmark name:', landmark.description)
            print('Landmark location:', landmark.locations)
            print('Detection confidence score:', landmark.score)

# Accept user inputs
print('\n')
image_dir = input('Enter the image directory: ')
bucket_name = input('Enter the bucket name: ')

# Call functions
print('\n', 'Getting image names...')
image_abspath_list = get_image_names(image_dir)
print(' DONE', '\n')

print('\n', 'Uploading images to cloud storage...')
relative_storage_uris = upload_landmark_images(bucket_name, image_abspath_list)
print(' DONE', '\n')

print('\n', 'Extracting landmark information...')
get_landmark_information(relative_storage_uris)
print('\n', '+' * 100, '\n')
print(' DONE... All information displayed!')
print('\n\n')

----

=== Running the script

Run the `main.py` file. In the terminal, you will see an output similar to the following:

[source, bash]
----
$ python3 main.py 

Enter the image directory: IMAGE_DIRECTORY
Enter the bucket name: BUCKET_NAME

Getting image names...
